MY PROJECT FOR CH2
For this challenge I decided to replicate, analyze and build the explore screen and add to watchlist screen from the app "B.Roll-track movies and shows" developed by Salvatore Emanuele Agosta.
I focused on analyzing the design of the interface to gain a deep understanding of the Human Interface Guidelines and of coding basics.
In order to meet this goal I implemented 2 working features in the explore screen, a filtering menu dropdown and the navigation from each card of the collections to a screen showing the movie details.
